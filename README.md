## Concept 
In this project I visualized my idea of the article. The article is about 7 moments hiphop changed the American history. 
When reading this intresting story I came to the realization that the hiphon genre now is not what it has been. The article it self gives a great explanation where hiphop came from (political deposition) and where where we are now (Showoffs & vibes). This is is kind of the backstory and I wanted to bring this to light in my story. 

We begin with the creation of hiphop on the intro page and after that the 7 moments divided into sections. I tell my story through illustrations of music instruments & supporting audio for titel/ topic explanation. I also add an abstract audio timeline for detailed information. I tried to visualize the story as best as possible!

## Discription

- I added a microphone on the **itnro section** as the synonym for letting know where that black people also exists. This was their instrument for letting white people know that they existed and the main instrument in the hiphop culture.

- On the **second section** there is a record player as intrument. This is where *DJ kool Herc* begins his blockparties with. I added the song: *A Tribe Called Quest* - Can I Kick It. Not to be confused with the song from *Lou Reed* - Walk on the Wild Side. Because this was the time of experimental hiphop where everywhere in amerika begin their own variation of the genre by sampling exicting tracks and addding their own voice. 

- On the **third section** we have the old school cassette tape as an instrument. This beacause this is how they exchanged their music and recorded their tracks. I added the song from *Killer Mike* called 'Reagan' which was an indictment agains him. Reagan was the main reason for developing the culture by abolishing the social benefits for the poor. 

- On the **fourth section** we see the instument called a 'gettoblaster' This was a big boombox where the literally blasted their music through to be heard by the people. This is also where the art forms: graffiti and breakdance began too grow. For the titelsong I choose: Cruisin' In My 64 from rapper/drug kingpin *Eazy-E*. drug money that funded the hiphop. 

- On **fifth section** we got a studio setup and this is where hiphop took a turn to the more richer aspects. with the TCA (Telecommunications Act) which implies that one radio station may take more than one channel. This was the downfall for 
local hiphop radio station. Big radio stations began to sign rappers and decided where people wanted too listen to (Pimp, Ho trinity). With that and also the dead of rap legends *Tupac Shakur* and *Biggie Smalls* made a huge impact on the hiphop culture.(After these incidents some say hiphop changed for ever) For this titel I choose the song of the more Pimp Ho trinity rapper *50 Cent* called: In Da Club. 

- On the **sixth section** we got a tv as an instument. This is more where rappers began to appear on tv shows like MTV Raps and began entrance to the more whealthy life. White poeple saw these rapper as gangster and began to immitate/ like them because of their real life/ thug life attitude that they didnt have. Also big fashion brands like adidas, tommy hilfiger etc. Began to see the rappers as influencers and provided them with clothing. For this Titel the track: Bad Boy For Life form *Puff Daddy* seemed a perfect fit for me. 

- On the **seventh section** we have the dj setup from where more producing beats came into play. The essence behind the lyrics where on a thin treat, the meaning behind the words where soft/ meant nothing. This is where the beat / producers became more populair. But on the other side there was a victory for the black people and the the hiphop culture when obama took the thone/ became president of the united states. (In my opinion he is one of the best presidents ever) for the song a perfect fit seemed *2pac* with: Changes, this is al Tupac wanted. 

- On the **last section** we have a spotify setup and this is how we listen to the hiphop music now a day. I choose the song of rapper: *Kendrick Lamar* Alright. He is one of the present rappers that is still cares about lyrics and wheres the hiphop genre came from. The song is called arlight, it describes the situation of black/ afrocentric people in america today.
